# Firefox Installation Guide

This extension has been adapted to work with Firefox. Here's how to install and test it:

## Install the Development Version in Firefox

1. **Get the code** (if you haven't already):
   - Clone this repo: `git clone git@github.com:GreyRook/gr-harvest-helper.git`
   - Or download as a zip and unzip it

2. **Load the extension in Firefox**:
   - navigate to the folder containing the extension files and run `zip -r gr-harvest-helper-firefox.zip .`
   - Open Firefox
   - Navigate to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
   - Click on "Load Temporary Add-on..."
   - Navigate to the extension folder and select the `gr-harvest-helper-firefox.zip` file
   - The extension should now be loaded!

3. **Testing**:
   - Navigate to a Jira issue page
   - Click the extension icon in the toolbar
   - The Harvest timer popup should appear with the issue details pre-filled

## For Permanent Installation (Unsigned)

If you want to keep the extension loaded permanently during development:

1. Open `about:config` in Firefox
2. Search for `xpinstall.signatures.required`
3. Set it to `false` (this allows unsigned extensions)
4. Follow the steps above in `about:debugging`

**Note**: Regular Firefox releases require extensions to be signed. For development, use Firefox Developer Edition or Firefox Nightly where you can disable signature verification.

## Building for Production (Firefox Add-ons)

To publish on [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org):

1. Create a zip file of the extension:
   ```bash
   zip -r gr-harvest-helper-firefox.zip . -x "*.git*" -x "node_modules/*" -x "*.md" -x "docs/*"
   ```

2. Submit to [Firefox Add-ons Developer Hub](https://addons.mozilla.org/developers/)

## Key Changes Made for Firefox Compatibility

- Changed `manifest_version` from 3 to 2 (better Firefox support)
- Changed `action` to `browser_action` (MV2 syntax)
- Changed `service_worker` to `scripts` array in background
- Added `browser_specific_settings` with gecko-specific configuration
- Changed permissions from `scripting` to `<all_urls>` for content script injection
- Updated API calls to use `browser` namespace (already present in code)
- Made `browser.tabs.query` use promises instead of callbacks

## Differences from Chrome Version

The main differences are in the manifest file structure. The extension code itself uses the `browser` API which works on both Chrome (via polyfill) and Firefox natively.
